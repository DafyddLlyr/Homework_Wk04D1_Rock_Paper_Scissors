Create a simple sinatra app to allow the user to play rock, paper, scissors in their browser.

- [x] You should be able to go to /rock/scissors and return the string "rock wins" to the page, for example.

- [x] You will need to write a bit of logic that compares the two hands and decides which one has won, and then use that in the route definition.

- [x] Next, create a `models` directory for your game logic class e.g. 'Game' and put all of the logic in there - there shouldn't be any logic left in the controller!

- [x] Ensure you build the model using Test Driven Development!

### Extensions:

- [x] Add an ERB view file for returning the result of the game, rather than just sending a string.

- [x] Add a welcome page (and a route to get it) to explain the rules before the user picks their move. Add a link to this on the result view.

- [x] Add some CSS to either/both of your pages.
